PhotoLodge Web Application

Thanks for checking out my PhotoLodge Web Application!

PhotoLodge is meant to be an online photo album focused on organization. I do digital art and I had the idea because my reference folder grew too large and become hard to manage with just folders/sub-folders alone. So I had the idea to create a photo album where tags/descriptions could be applied to images so that, with the help of a search feature, they could be found quickly and easily!

User Story:

Ideally, a user should land on the login page where they have the choice of logging in or signing up.

Once signed up, user can upload their first image. When uploading an can enter these details before hitting submit:
  - Title
  - Tags
  - Description
  - Folder

On the home page, images are displayed to user in sections of Folders, Tagged, and Untagged.
Alternatively, the user can use the All Files page via the navbar to view all images unorganized.

The user can then use the search bar located at the top of the page to filter through image(s) to find what they are looking for.

Other features a user can take advantage of include:
  - Deleting images and editing image details.
  - Creating, editing, and deleting folders.
  - Logging out.
